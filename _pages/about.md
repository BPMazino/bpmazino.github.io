I am a Master 2 student in Mathematics, Vision, and Learning at École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay, specializing in the intersection of mathematical theory and practical machine learning applications. My research spans deep learning theory, computer vision, medical imaging, and geometric learning methods.

## Current Focus

I am currently preparing for an exciting internship at BioMaps (CEA & Université Paris-Saclay) starting April 2025, where I will develop a 3D CycleGAN for translating CT scans to MRI images, followed by implementing vessel segmentation models on the translated images. This project combines my interests in generative models, medical imaging, and 3D computer vision.

## Research Experience

My research journey has taken me across diverse domains of AI and mathematics. At École Polytechnique's LIX laboratory, I worked on set-based analysis of ReLU neural networks using tropical polyhedra representations, developing novel over-approximation techniques for tropical rational functions. This work bridged my interests in formal methods and neural network theory.

At Collège de France's CIRB, I enhanced neural networks for phylogenetic analysis by integrating geometric and tree-based constraints, implementing iterative projection algorithms to improve model accuracy. I've also contributed to vocal signal processing at LISN, engineering models for vocal strength restoration through controlled acoustic degradations.

My theoretical foundations were strengthened through formal verification work at ENS Paris-Saclay's LMF, where I developed formal commutation proofs using the Coq proof assistant and contributed to the Trakt proof database.

## Technical Expertise

I work primarily with Python and PyTorch for deep learning applications, with additional experience in functional programming (OCaml), formal verification (Coq), and mathematical computing. My mathematical background encompasses optimization theory, tropical geometry, differential geometry, category theory, and topological data analysis.

## Research Interests

- **Medical Imaging & Computer Vision**: 3D image translation, generative models for healthcare applications
- **Geometric Deep Learning**: Point cloud processing, manifold learning, and geometric neural architectures  
- **Mathematical Foundations of AI**: Tropical geometry in neural networks, formal verification, optimization theory
- **Constrained Learning**: Physics-informed neural networks, geometric constraints in learning systems

## Personal Projects

I maintain a curated repository of influential AI/ML papers implemented from scratch, including architectures like DiffusionNet, PointNet, and YOLOv1. This practice deepens my understanding of foundational concepts while ensuring code clarity and faithfulness to original research.

I am passionate about bridging the gap between mathematical rigor and practical AI applications, particularly in domains where safety and interpretability are paramount.
